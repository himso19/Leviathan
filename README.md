# Leviathan
I was on Blue Team, building active defenses. My job was to make systems proactively hostile to attackers. I used Kyverno for security-as-code, Cosign to cryptographically lock down software supply chain, planted honeytokens to detect intruders, and use Chaos Mesh to break things on purpose, ensuring defenses held under pressure.
